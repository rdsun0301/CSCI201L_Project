MyPage is a web service that allows users to create, edit, and publish their own websites.

Users can make an account from the main page. After an email confirmation, the user can log in and start adding websites to their account. Multiple users can work on the same website concurrently through multithreaded implementation. Users are then able to publish their website on the web through a GitHub Pages URL, or through a specified domain.
